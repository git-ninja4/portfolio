Real Estate SQL Data Analysis Project
Welcome to my Real Estate SQL Data Analysis project! This repository contains the code and documentation for my analysis of real estate data using SQL.

Overview
In this project, I have conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing real estate information using SQL queries. The dataset includes information such as property prices, square footage, and more. Through SQL queries, I've extracted valuable insights to help understand market trends, identify lucrative opportunities, and make data-driven decisions in the real estate industry.

Key Findings
Average Property Prices: Identified the average property prices in different regions.
Price Trends: Analyzed price trends over time to identify fluctuations and seasonality.
Square Footage Analysis: Investigated the correlation between property prices and square footage.

How to Run
To reproduce the analysis or explore the dataset further, follow these steps:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Import the dataset into your SQL database management system.
Execute the SQL queries provided in sql_queries.sql to perform the analysis.
